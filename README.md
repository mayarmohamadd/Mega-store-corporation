Project: Mega store corporation
There is a corporation that acts as a mega store for retail and wholesaling services. It operates a 
chain of hypermarkets, groceries stores, and convenience stores. It has more than 200 stores in 
over 10 countries. It has different types of stores, about 20 hypermarkets, and more than 180 
smaller supermarkets and convenience stores. Each country has a different number of stores 
based on its size and population. 
It supports many types of categories, such as fruits and vegetables, dairy products, meat and 
poultry, grocery, beverages, cooking ingredients, TVs and appliances, laundry and detergents, 
cleaning essentials, personal care, baby care, frozen food, bakery and pastry, and healthy food. It 
also provides the best prices for all categories. It has different deals with various suppliers to 
provide these variations of products. These suppliers are spread over different cities per country. 
Accordingly, the mega store corporation has its own warehouses as well as rented warehouses 
per country. 
It provides different services for its customers. These services are on-site and off-site. The offsite services are achieved through online services either through store websites per country or a 
mobile application customized per user location. The on-site services allow the customers to buy 
from a physical location. The corporation is interested in raising awareness about the 
environment. It provides special bags that help in reducing plastic waste and helps the recycling 
operation. These bags are reusable and help customers gain points.
It attracts many customers with the support of different payment techniques and packages. Each 
one of them is synchronized with a system that helps customers to gain points per purchase
operation. These points are affected by special offers announced for a limited time.
There are different offers throughout the year that vary with the occasion, either affected by local 
or global events. For example, in the new year, there are special offers for pastry products, TVs, 
and kitchen appliances. These offers can also differ per country and payment method. There are 
different return policies for different types of products, there are products that can be returned on 
the same day, e.g., fresh food, dairy, and pastry products, if the product has gone bad. Otherwise, 
they are not accepted for return. Other categories, such as appliances, have a different returnpolicy which includes physical or technical defects within 14 days only. Moreover, the 
corporation does not support any after-sale services for appliances.
This mega store corporation needs help in enhancing its services to be automatically adjustable 
to each country and customer preferences based on search and purchase history. This includes 
web services and mobile services. Also, it needs to gain competition by providing various 
payment techniques and packages.
